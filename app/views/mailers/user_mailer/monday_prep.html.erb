    <p>Hey there!</p>
    <p>
      Itâ€™s the start of a new week and we want to make sure you hit your goal of
      <%= @user.goal&.target || Goal::DEFAULT_TARGET %> noes. Sign in now to
      view the contacts you need to reach out to.
    </p>
    <%= link_to 'View my Dashboard',
                dashboard_url,
                role: 'button',
                class: 'btn btn-primary btn-lg' %>
    <p>
      Important: create touchpoints after you interact with a contact &mdash;
      it's the only way you'll remember previous conversations and know what
      next steps to take with them.
