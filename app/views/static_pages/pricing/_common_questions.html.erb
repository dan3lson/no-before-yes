    <h3>Will we be charged as soon as our 30-day free trial ends?</h3>
    <p>
      No. When you sign up for a 30-day free trial, we don't ask you for any
      payment details. When you're ready to join as a paid customer, select the
      plan you want and provide your payment details then. Cancel whenever you
      want without any pressure.
